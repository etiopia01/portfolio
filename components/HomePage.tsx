                <p className="w-[50%] text-sm text-slate-500"> Hi! I'm an aspiring Web Developer.
                     In early 2023, I earned a Bachelor's degree in languages and literatures.
                      However, my passion for coding led me to swiftly change my career path.
                       Now, I'm on an exciting journey to master the art of web development. 
                       With a foundation in languages and a knack for problem-solving, 
                       I'm committed to continuously growing my knowledge and explore new opportunities.
                        My current skill-set consists mainly of the following front-end technologies: 
                        html5, CSS, tailwindcss, TypeScript, React and Next.js.
                        Let's make something happen! </p>
